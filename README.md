# Simple-shell

### This is a collaborative project with contributions from ``Thembisile Makamu`` and ``Adora Onyile`` as part of the requirements of the ALX_SWE program.

## General
### The ``Simple Shell`` requires creating a basic UNIX command line interpreter in C. The shell allows users to execute basic commands and handles basic functionalities like the UNIX shell ``/bin/sh``.

### Learning objectives
- Shell functionalities
- Process creation and environment manipulation
- System and function calls
- Problem solving (thinking like an engineer)
- Teamwork and collaboration

## Task Overview
### Mandatory
- Task 0: Code formatting following Betty's standards.
- Task 1: Development of a basic UNIX command line interpreter.
- Task 2: Handling command lines with arguments.
- Task 3: Implementing PATH handling and process forking.
- Task 4: Incorporating an exit built-in command for shell termination.
- Task 5: Integration of the env built-in command to display the environment.

### Advanced
- Task 6: Custom getline function implementation for optimized reading.
- Task 7: Advanced implementation without using strtok.
- Task 8: Enhancements in exit built-in handling arguments.
- Task 9: Implementation of setenv and unsetenv built-in commands.
- Task 10: Incorporation of the cd built-in command for directory changes.
- Task 11: Handling commands separator (;) for shell functionality.
- Task 12: Implementing shell logical operators (&& and ||).
- Task 13: Introduction of the alias built-in command.
- Task 14: Handling variable replacement, including special variables like $? and $$.
- Task 15: Handling comments within command lines.
- Task 16: Shell execution from a file as input.
